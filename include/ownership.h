 * both compile to the same extent_at_least/element_extent machinery.
 * There is deliberately no floating-point sibling yet: the proof goes
 * through SValBuilder::makeIntVal, which only builds integer and pointer
 * constants, and IEEE-754 equality has real semantics (NaN, signed zero)
 * a literal integer comparison does not model -- a double_sentinel would

 *     (their libc implementations may take an internal lock), so this is
 *     not implied by, and does not imply, io_operation below.
 *   - io_operation: this function performs I/O or a syscall, which
 *     tools/clang/PurityChecker.cpp's isIoCall() treats as a real,
 *     externally observable side effect that disqualifies
 *     __attribute__((pure)) eligibility. Reads this back instead of
